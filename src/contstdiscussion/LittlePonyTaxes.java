 "With Great Earning comes Great Taxes."
 Little Ponny is frustrated after paying too much tax, therefore, he asked his friend Little Jonny for help.

 Jonny advised him to transfer all his amount in a private Swiss Bank to save his money from tax.

 But the process of transferring money is Illegal and thus very dangerous too; thus, he can only send 1 dollar to his new account in 1 day.

 Little Ponny has N accounts, and i'th account contains A[i] dollars. For i'th account, he has to pay B[i] amount of tax daily (if this account has at least one dollar). He wants to transfer all of his money as soon as possible.

 Can you help him do find the minimum amount of tax he needs to pay until the transfer completes?

 Since, the result can be large, print it modulo 109 + 7
